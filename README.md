Save Generated QR Code: Users can specify the file path and name to save the generated QR code image with their desired format (e.g., .png, .jpg).

## How to Use:
Installation: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from python.org.

Download the Script: Clone or download the Python QR code generator script to your local machine.

Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and execute it using Python:

Where and with what name do you want to save the image (include the extension, e.g. .png): example_qr_code.png
```
